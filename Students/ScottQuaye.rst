	Hello there, I am new to programming and I look forward to learning a lot and finding new ways to grow my skillset.

		I have an interest in network and system security and I hope to become a penetration tester in the future.

	Here is a schedule of an American Patriot. We should all be as awesome as this BAMF was.
